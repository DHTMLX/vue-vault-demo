The DHTMLX [JavaScript file upload library](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxVault/) allows building a user-friendly client-side tool for uploading
and managing various file types intuitively. The widget includes manual and auto file upload, filtering, and sorting. You can customize its look and feel by adding custom templates or configurable built-in themes.
